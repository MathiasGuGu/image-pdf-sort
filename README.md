# Image to PDF sort
A simple application that lets you upload images, sort the order and export in the selected order as a PDF.
No files are stored on any server, everything is local to you.
PDFs are generated by [jspdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf). Check it out, it is great.

## Info
This was built in 10 minutes. I will be continuing on the UI and UX, but feel free to fork it, style it, contribute and all of that.
